She whispered in my ear, "You won't recognize any of the ingredients in here, not yet. Just know you are destined for greater things. You came to truly trust me, unlike that shipwrecked, no-good island king from centuries ago. Alas, I have to go now, but I promise that I won't ever forget you.""

Thoth is with you, my friend."\n\nAnd so, I remembered who I truly was: #italic Imhotep#!.\n\nI, who built the world's first pyramid, was also sorcerer of the Pharaoh. But our enemies and their sorcerers cursed me with immortality. The sufferings I saw across the centuries were unimaginable, so much so that I concocted a potion to make me forget my past lives and past sorrows. However, this potion was starting to lose its effectiveness after several decades, and giving me side effects like making it seem like I was dying."
