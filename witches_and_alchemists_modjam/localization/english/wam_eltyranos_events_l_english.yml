 wam_eltyranos.0001.desc:0 "Several locals come at you at the local market you are inspecting.\n\nWe saw a witch the other day. It was dusk and we were on our way back from the tavern. She was carrying a broom and a pointy hat. We tried to catch her in order to bring her to you, but she immediately got on her broom and took off!\n\nAs you investigate, many persons seem to have seen a comet going backwards. This sounds like a bad omen."

 wam_eltyranos.0001.b:0 "I sounds dangerous. Let's forget about it."
 
 wam_eltyranos.0002.desc:0 "After you followed the locals to a remote hut, a woman is already attached to a pile of dry wood.\n\nI am innocent, she says. She pleads that Tim the farmer is trying for years to get her land in order to extend his own fields.\n\nTim says he saw her turn someone into a newt. He does not sound very convincing.\n\n[court_chaplain.GetName] says that given her costume, she must be a witch."
