 wam_jabir_ibn_hayyan_modifier_desc:0 "Jabir is an alchemist of great intelligence but mysterious origins. He teaches a philosophical theory called "The Science of Balance" (or #italic 'ilm al-mīzān#! in Arabic), and seeks to spend his life understanding the world. Some say he resembles the legendary alchemist #italic Jabir ibn Hayyan#!, but Jabir denies such claims. After all, the other Jabir died years before this Jabir was born – they can't possibly be the same person! Right...?\n\n#italic Jabir has access to a few special [decisions|E] that allow him to improve his abilities, particularly in alchemy; other alchemists can also try to contact him via a [character_interaction|E] to enhance their study of alchemy as well.#!"
